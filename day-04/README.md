üéØ **Day 04 ‚Äì TTS + Echo Bot with Murf AI**

Welcome to Day 4 of the **30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge**!
Today‚Äôs focus was on adding an **Echo Bot** feature that lets users record and play back their voice in the browser ‚Äî alongside the existing text-to-speech functionality.

üß† **What We Built**

A voice app that:
- Accepts text input from the user
- Dynamically fetches available voice options from the Murf API
- Lets the user select a voice before generating speech
- Sends both the text and selected voice to the Murf API
- Plays the resulting audio in the browser
- Allows users to record their own voice using the mic
- Plays back the recorded audio as an echo

üõ† **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`  
- **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript` (MediaRecorder API)
- **Voice API**: Murf AI ‚Äì `/voices` and `/speech/generate` endpoints

üîê **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of `day-03/`: <br>
MURF_API_KEY=your_actual_murf_api_key

Make sure to use a valid voice ID in the request payload (e.g., `en-US-natalie`).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run the App**

cd day-03/ <br>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br>
uvicorn main:app --reload

Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

üß™ **Test Input**

Try typing something like: <br>
"This is Day 4 of the Voice Agent Challenge." <br>
Select a voice from the dropdown, then click Generate Voice.

To test the echo feature, click Start Recording, speak into your mic, and then click Stop Recording to hear it played back.

If fetching voices from the API fails, a fallback list of voices is used automatically.
