# Day 19: Streaming LLM Responses

Welcome to Day 19 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today, we're making our voice agent even more responsive by **streaming the Large Language Model's (LLM) response** back to the server.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **Streaming LLM Integration**: Once the final transcription is received from AssemblyAI, it is immediately sent to the LLM API to generate a response.
  * **Real-Time Response Generation**: The server is now able to receive the LLM's response as a stream of text chunks.
  * **Console Output for Streaming Response**: The incoming text chunks from the LLM are accumulated and printed to the server's console in real-time, allowing us to see the response as it's being generated.
  * **Preparation for Streaming to Client**: This lays the groundwork for sending the LLM's response to the client in real-time in a future step.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack has been updated to handle streaming responses from the LLM.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, **`google-generativeai` (with streaming)**, `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, `MediaRecorder` API, `WebSocket API`
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Text-to-Speech)
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * **Google Gemini (Streaming Large Language Model)**

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd day-19/
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.
