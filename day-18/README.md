# Day 18: Real-Time Transcription with Turn Detection

Welcome to Day 18 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today, we are enhancing our real-time transcription feature by implementing **turn detection** with AssemblyAI's streaming API. This will allow our voice agent to know when the user has finished speaking.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **Turn Detection**: The server now leverages AssemblyAI's turn detection to identify when the user has stopped speaking.
  * **End-of-Turn Notifications**: A WebSocket message is sent from the server to the client to signify the end of a user's turn.
  * **UI Updates on Turn End**: The user interface is updated to display the final transcription only after a turn is completed, creating a more intuitive user experience.

-----

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack has been updated to incorporate AssemblyAI's turn detection feature.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai` (Streaming Client with Turn Detection), `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, `MediaRecorder` API, **WebSocket API**
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Text-to-Speech)
      * **AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)**
      * Google Gemini (Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd day-18/
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The main changes are in `main.py` to handle turn detection events and in `static/script.js` to process the end-of-turn messages.
