# Day 13: Comprehensive Project Documentation

Welcome to Day 13 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today's focus shifted from coding to a crucial aspect of software development: **documentation**. The primary task was to create a detailed `README.md` file for the root of the project, providing a comprehensive overview for anyone visiting the repository.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  - **Root README.md**: A new, detailed `README.md` file was created at the project's root. This file includes:
      - A high-level description of the conversational voice agent.
      - A list of key features.
      - An overview of the technologies and APIs used.
      - An explanation of the application's architecture.
      - Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project locally, including environment variable setup.
  - **No Code Changes**: This task was purely about documentation, so the application's code and functionality remain the same as in Day 12.

-----

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The technology stack remains the same, integrating multiple AI services with a FastAPI backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

  - **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai`
  - **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, `MediaRecorder` API
  - **AI APIs**:
      - Murf AI (Text-to-Speech)
      - AssemblyAI (Speech-to-Text)
      - Google Gemini (Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

The instructions to run the application are unchanged.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd day-13/
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `day-13/` directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit http://localhost:8000. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The main change is the addition of the `README.md` file at the root of the `30-days-of-voice-agents` repository.

```
